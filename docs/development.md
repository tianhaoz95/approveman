# Development

## Testing

Order of preference: unit tests (strongly recommended) > integration tests (necessary evil) > manual tests (strongly not recommended).

For rare cases where you need to manually test the app behavior, please only install the testing app on [this repository](https://github.com/tianhaoz95/approveman-test).

## Tools

The recommended editor for development is Visual Studio Code since the project has a corresponding configuration file that should work out-of-box.
