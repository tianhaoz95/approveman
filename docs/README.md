ApproveMan is a GitHub app that helps approve pull requests with safe changes.

## Motivation

To maintain the health of repositories, it's important to set up review policies to make sure every pull request is good.

GitHub provides "protected branches" as a way to enforce code review policies on incoming pull requests.

However, not all pull requests require human attention.

For example, it's reasonable for a repository to set up a location with a user's GitHub ID like `[project_root]/playground/${username}` to allow developers add quick experiments that they want to keep a record and share with the team.

In this case, if I want to add some notes in `[project_root]/playground/${username}/my-note.md`, there is no reason to ask another developer to review the change.

## Usage

## For GitHub

The app can be installed from the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/approveman).

You can configure the behavior by adding rules into `.github/approveman.yml`.

Here is an example that, given that my GitHub ID is `tianhaoz95`, approves all my changes that go into `playground/tianhaoz95` and `docs/personal/tianhaoz95`:

```yml
ownership_rules:
  directory_matching_rules:
    - name: personal projects in experimental
      path: playground/{{username}}/**/*
    - name: personal documentation
      path: docs/personal/{{username}}/**/*
```

Note:

-   The default config contains `playground/{{username}}/**/*` if no config file is provided in the repository.
-   All pull requests that modify files within `.github` the directory is denied regardless of the rules in the configuration for safety.

Here is an example of how it works:

### For GitHub Enterprise

To run a server for GitHub Enterprise, please also set `GHE_HOST` and `APP_ACTOR_NAME_OVERRIDE` before running the server:

```bash
# This will be the custom domain for your GitHub Enterprise
export GHE_HOST="github.example.com"

# The following is just an example, you will need to set it to
# the app's actor name that you assign it with in GitHub Enterprise
# integration.
export APP_ACTOR_NAME_OVERRIDE="project-name__approveman[bot]"

npm run build # Build the TypeScript source
npm start # Start the server
```

After the server is up and running, the rest should be the same as the [GitHub setup](#for-github).
